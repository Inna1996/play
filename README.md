## Rules of the game:

The first screen asks the user for the difficulty level. The number of cards depends on the difficulty level, from which you will need to guess where the bug is.

+ Simple - 3 cards.
+ Medium - 6 cards.
+ Hard - 10 cards.

After choosing the difficulty, the user clicks on the "Start game" button. A field with maps appears. All card meanings are hidden. All cards except one are blank. One of the maps is a bug. The user can choose any one card. After clicking on the map, the map flips over with animation. The card can be of two values.

+ Empty.
+ With a bug.

Then the user can click on the map and return to the beginning of the game - step 1.
